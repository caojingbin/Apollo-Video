The current video site faces many problems.
  
The first problem is that the creators of content have no way to obtain direct economic returns 💰. The traditional solution is to protect them by copyright. However, when copyright 📝 is damaged, it takes a lot of cost to defend rights, and the failure rate of rights protection is also very high.
