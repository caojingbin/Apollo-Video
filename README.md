**Our Slogan ： 🚀Who will be the next Armstrong?👨‍🚀**   
**We created a free content planet🌏, do you want to land it🛩？**

# Background
The current video site faces many **PROBLEMS**🙅‍♂️.
  
**The first problem** is that the creators of content is hard to obtain direct economic returns 💰,most of the revenue from the content has been earned by the platform (Including publishing houses and online platforms). One of the traditional solution is to protect them by copyright. However, when copyright 📝 is damaged, it takes a lot of cost to defend rights, and the failure rate of rights protection is also very high.  
  
**The second problem** is that the rights of users on the traditional video platform are very low ☔️, users participate in the contribution of the content community through comments, likes and forwards,but they can only passively accept advertisements or pay funds💲.  Under the purpose of Web 3.0, all users should participate in the construction of the platform, and then they get reward ,so that the platform could becomes more robust.  
  
**The third problem** is the regulatory issue of content. When the video platform opens up the free upload function, it will inevitably lead to violations. Traditional video platforms are regulated by manual review, but this approach is inefficient and costly. Even so, there is no way to judge the content of violations fairly, because the formulation of evaluation standards is centralized🐻.

**In order to solve such problems, Apollo Video put forward a new purpose.**
