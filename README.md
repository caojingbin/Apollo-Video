# Apollo-Video
> A video content platform based on decentralized community governance and distributed networks.   
  
**Our Slogan ： 🚀Who will be the next Armstrong?👨‍🚀** 

#Background
The current video site faces many **PROBLEMS**🙅‍♂️.
  
**The first problem** is that the creators of content have no way to obtain direct economic returns 💰. The traditional solution is to protect them by copyright. However, when copyright 📝 is damaged, it takes a lot of cost to defend rights, and the failure rate of rights protection is also very high.  
  
**The second problem** is that the rights of users on the traditional video platform are very low ☔️, and they can only passively accept advertisements or pay funds💲, and cannot participate in the construction of the video platform. Most of the benefits are taken away by the platform. Under the purpose of Web 3.0, all users should participate in the construction of the platform, so that the platform becomes more robust.
